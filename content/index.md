# wisconsin

A [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz)-powered static site for organizing and presenting course materials from the
University of Wisconsin-Madison.

## Overview

This repository contains the framework and configuration for generating a static documentation site deployed
at [wisconsin.twango.dev](https://wisconsin.twango.dev).

The setup is **Obsidian-compatible**, allowing you to edit notes locally in Obsidian while maintaining version control
through Git and automated deployments for web access. This creates a seamless workflow for note-taking, version control,
and sharing.

> [!WARNING]
> **Academic Compliance**: All course materials remain in private submodules to comply with academic policies. This
> public repository contains only the site frameworkâ€”no assignments, solutions, or proprietary content are exposed. The
> deployed site is access-controlled to protect course content.
