A [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz)-powered static site for organizing and presenting course materials from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

## Overview

This repository contains the framework and configuration for generating a static documentation site deployed at [wisconsin.twango.dev](https://wisconsin.twango.dev).

The setup is **Obsidian-compatible**, allowing you to edit notes locally in Obsidian while maintaining version control through Git and automated deployments for web access. This creates a seamless workflow for note-taking, version control, and sharing.

## Quick Start

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```
